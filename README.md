ðŸ§  About This Project

This project is a practice repository where Iâ€™ve learned and implemented various Projects.

I followed tutorials by Faisal Memon on his YouTube channel â€” EmbarkX - YouTube â€” and used his sample code for learning purposes.

This project is not originally created by me from scratch.
Iâ€™ve used the code and made modifications as part of my learning journey.

âœ… Future Enhancements

I plan to enhance this further by adding my own features and experiments as I continue learning backend.
