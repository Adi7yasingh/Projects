🧠 About This Project
This project is a practice repository where I’ve learned and implemented various Spring Boot concepts.

I followed tutorials by Faisal Memon on his YouTube channel — EmbarkX - YouTube — and used his sample code for learning purposes.

📝 Disclaimer
This project is not originally created by me from scratch.
I’ve used the code and made modifications as part of my learning journey.

✅ Future Enhancements
I plan to enhance this further by adding my own features and experiments as I continue learning Spring Boot.
